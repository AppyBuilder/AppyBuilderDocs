# Concept Cards

Concept Cards provide a quick way to learn new AppyBuilder code and concepts. 

Each of the cards can be printed out, folded in half, and used to prompt students to explore a concept in AppyBuilder such as Sprites, timers, sounds, movement, multi screens, making colors, etc. 

These cards are designed to introduce ideas to students in bite-sized snippets and can be worked into any lesson or tutorial.

Thanks to [@Peter\_Mathijssen](http://community.appybuilder.com/u/peter_mathijssen) for his contribution on designing sharing the cards
