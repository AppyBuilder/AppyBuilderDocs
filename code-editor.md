# Code Editor

If you are extension developer, AppyBuilder Code-Editor \(_**Beta version**_\) allows you to create / build extensions \(plugins\) with ease of use. It is a fully fledged cloud-based platform that includes all the necessary tools to allow you to build your extension. This means that you don't need to download any special tools \(e.g. Java, AI, Ant, Python, etc.\) to your computer and all you need to do is just to point your browser to [https://editor.AppyBuilder.com](https://Editor.AppyBuilder.com). _**Special thanks to**_ [_**ConDigital**_](https://community.appybuilder.com/u/condigital/summary) _**and**_ [_**Ken**_](https://community.appybuilder.com/u/ken/summary) _**for their awesome teamwork to make this happen.**_

_**NOTE: This is only Beta version. We have attempted very hard to create you this service. However, by using this service, you accept that you don't hold us responsible for possible loss of projects.**_

To create New Project, click on "New Project" and you'll be presented with pop-up shown below. At this time, you'll be presented with 5 choices. Currently, only Aix and Java are activated for BUILD. We are planning to release Php and Html in future releases.

You are now ready to create your awesome extension. Using this CodeEditor, you'll be able to change options such as Theme and Font-Size. Change it to your preference. You'll also notice icons for allowing such options as Save, Undo, Redo, Find, Replace, Line-Wrapping and Full-Screen \(great for mobile-use\). Once you are ready to create .aix, just click on BUILD button. You will be then presented with a dialog button like below:

Building of .aix time will be variable depending on volume and number of jobs in the queue. The system will automatically pop-up buttons when the build is ready \(below\). If there is build-error, you'll notice only 1 button for viewing the LOG \(Last Build Log\), otherwise, you'll also notice another button for downloading your .aix \("Download Aix\). _**NOTE: Your LOG and Aix will be available for 12 hours. After that, the buttons for "Download Aix" and "Download Log" will disappear**_

To view the Log, or download Aix, just click on the related button. Clicking on "Download AIX" will download the .aix to your device, allowing you to import into AI platform. For example, the general template for .aix, will create 2 blocks for you as shown below:

###  Public Gallery

AppyBuilder encourages sharing of information. It includes feature that allows projects to be marked as Private or Public \(default Private\). Once a project is marked as Public, it will be visible to everyone and can be used as a starting point for customizing and creating new extensions. To select and work with a public project, Click on "New Project", then select "Public Gallery":

Once "Public Gallery" is selected, all public projects will be displayed like below:

On selection of a public project, a copy of the project will be added to your projects. The project WILL NOT be saved until you click on the Save icon. After that, this project will be added as PRIVATE to list of your own projects:
