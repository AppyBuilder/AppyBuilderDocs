You can get the TaifunTools extension here: [https://puravidaapps.com/tools.php](https://puravidaapps.com/tools.php)

And the following blocks. No fancy formula, just straight forward.

And the result will be

The html-files use a small css file for formatting the text. But you can play with that.

You can use the cheatsheet here for the icons: [https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet](https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet)

**A little tip:** If you use an arrangement or use the webviewer at 100% or fill parent the sidebar will not show. There has to be some background available. So set the webviewer to a width of 95% for instance to make it work.

In the aia file there is a fontfile included, 3 html files, an image, a css file and the TaifunTools extension.
