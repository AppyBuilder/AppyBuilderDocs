The html-files use a small css file for formatting the text. But you can play with that.

**A little tip:**
If you use an arrangement or use the webviewer at 100% or fill parent the sidebar will not show. There has to be some background available. So i set the webviewer at 95% width to make it work.

In the aia file there is a fontfile included, 3 html files, a css file and the TaifunTools extension.
