This component has blocks / events that are shown in image blow. **LoadAd** block is executed automatically on startup. If Ad is successfully loaded, the **AdLoaded** event will be triggered. DO NOT use LoadAd block in this event because it will create an infinite loop. If the Ad fails to load, then **AdFailedToLoad** will be triggered and you can check the Error or message parameters to inspect why Ad was not served

**ShowInterstatialAd** block can be used to display the AD that was last loaded.

**AdClosed** block, gets triggered when AD is closed. In this block, you can use LoadAd block to load the next ad and prepare for next AD display.

The AD can be displayed when changing screens or when user clicks a button. DO NOT encourage user to click in order to display the AD. Please follow Ad Guidance shown above.
