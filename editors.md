# AppyBuilder Editors

AppyBuilder editors include 2 editors; one for designing the layout of the screen and the other for coding the app behaviour

### **Designer Editor**

This editor is used for selecting components of the app and designing the user interface or layout. It will also allow you to select components and specify the initial properties for each component such as background image, color, width, etc.

### **Blocks Editor**

Block Editor is where you program for apps logic and its behavior. In this editor, youâ€™ll see all the components that were added in the design editor. The block editor provides you a drag and drop interface to program the behavior of the app by piecing together jigsaw-like blocks.

In design editor you visually select components and layout the apps screens layout. In block editor, those components will be available for programming. Each component type \(e.g. Button\), will have a set of pre-defined properties and event handlers which are presented in form of blocks.
