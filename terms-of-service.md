Welcome to AppyBuilder's website \(the "Site"\) [http://AppyBuilder.com](http://AppyBuilder.com) and its platforms \(such as [http://gold.AppyBuilder.com\](http://gold.AppyBuilder.com%29\), collectively referred to as "Services". The Services runs on Google's App Engine service. You must read and agree to these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy \(collectively, the "Terms"\) prior to using any portion of this Services. These Terms are an agreement between you and AppyBuilder. If you do not understand or do not agree to be bound by these Terms, please immediately exit and contact us at [http://info@AppyBuilder.com](http://info@AppyBuilder.com).

## Account Required for Use of AppyBuilder

In order to log in to AppyBuilder, you need to use a Google account. Your use of that account is subject to Google's Terms of Service for accounts, and the information you provide to Google is governed by Google's Privacy Policy. AppyBuilder has no access to your Google account or the information you provide for it other than the account email address, which we may use to contact you. In the future, we may provide alternative means for using AppyBuilder without Google accounts, at which point we will update these terms of use to reflect those alternatives.

## Information about you

Beyond the name of your Google account, you do not have to tell us anything about yourself to download the AppyBuilder setup software or use the AppyBuilder Web site.

## The Apps you create

By creating and storing apps on the AppyBuilder server you represent and warrant that you are the owner and creator of the apps, \( i\) that you have the authority to authorize AppyBuilder to store the apps on the AppyBuilder Server and \(ii\) you will use the apps in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You, and not AppyBuilder, are solely responsible for your apps and your use of them.

AppyBuilder has no proprietary rights in the apps you create with AppyBuilder. These apps belong to you. Your apps are stored on the AppyBuilder server. You have the right to download your apps and delete them from the server at any time. If you delete an app, there is the possibility that AppyBuilder may be able to continue to access it from the backups we keep for purposes of system maintenance, but these backups are periodically purged and are not designed for long-term preservation. AppyBuilder will strive to keep your apps and your account accessible to you for as long as you wish, but we have no obligation to do so, and AppyBuilder has no liability for the consequences of the service becoming unavailable or your apps becoming unavailable. We therefore strongly suggest that you maintain backup copies of valuable apps at places besides the AppyBuilder server.

## Violation of Policies

AppyBuilder provides ability to add monetization to your apps. However, you should follow AdMob / Amazon Terms of Service \(ToS\). Please watch AdMob video guide below . It is very important to follow their ToS and guide. Violation of their ToS could cause suspension of your app or all apps published by you. If we notice repeated violations, we reserve the right to de-authorize your AppyBuilder account.
