**Last updated: April 01, 2018**

Welcome to AppyBuilder's website \(the "Site"\) [http://AppyBuilder.com](http://AppyBuilder.com) and its platforms \(such as [http://gold.AppyBuilder.com\](http://gold.AppyBuilder.com%29\), collectively referred to as "Services". The Services runs on Google's App Engine service. You must read and agree to these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy \(collectively, the "Terms"\) prior to using any portion of this Services. These Terms are an agreement between you and AppyBuilder. If you do not understand or do not agree to be bound by these Terms, please immediately exit and contact us at [http://info@AppyBuilder.com](http://info@AppyBuilder.com).

## Account Required for Use of AppyBuilder

In order to log in to AppyBuilder, you need to use a Google account. Your use of that account is subject to Google's Terms of Service for accounts, and the information you provide to Google is governed by Google's Privacy Policy. AppyBuilder has no access to your Google account or the information you provide for it other than the account email address, which we may use to contact you. In the future, we may provide alternative means for using AppyBuilder without Google accounts, at which point we will update these terms of use to reflect those alternatives.

## Information about you

Beyond the name of your Google account, you do not have to tell us anything about yourself to download the AppyBuilder setup software or use the AppyBuilder Web site.

## The Apps you create

By creating and storing apps on the AppyBuilder server you represent and warrant that you are the owner and creator of the apps, \( i\) that you have the authority to authorize AppyBuilder to store the apps on the AppyBuilder Server and \(ii\) you will use the apps in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You, and not AppyBuilder, are solely responsible for your apps and your use of them.

AppyBuilder has no proprietary rights in the apps you create with AppyBuilder. These apps belong to you. Your apps are stored on the AppyBuilder server. You have the right to download your apps and delete them from the server at any time. If you delete an app, there is the possibility that AppyBuilder may be able to continue to access it from the backups we keep for purposes of system maintenance, but these backups are periodically purged and are not designed for long-term preservation. AppyBuilder will strive to keep your apps and your account accessible to you for as long as you wish, but we have no obligation to do so, and AppyBuilder has no liability for the consequences of the service becoming unavailable or your apps becoming unavailable. We therefore strongly suggest that you maintain backup copies of valuable apps at places besides the AppyBuilder server.

## Analytics

AppyBuilder may collect and analyze data and other information relating to the provision, use and performance of various aspects of the Services and related systems and technologies \(including, without limitation, information concerning User Content and data derived therefrom\) \(“**Services Analytics Data**”\), and AppyBuilder will be free \(during and after the term hereof\) to \(i\) use such information and data for any purpose, including to improve and enhance the Services and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in connection with the Services and other AppyBuilder offerings, \(ii\) conduct industry research and publish insights and reports, and \(iii\) disclose such data solely in aggregate or other de-identified form in connection with its business.

You hereby grant us the right to: \(i\) add analytics plug-ins of our third party analytics service providers in Your App to allow them to collect Customer Analytics Data on behalf of AppyBuilder, and \(ii\) collect Customer Analytics Data as provided herein. You agree that your privacy policy will \(a\) clearly indicate that you use third party services providers, like and including, AppyBuilder, in order to make Your App\(s\) available, and that such third party services providers will have access to and will use such customer information in order to improve Services, and \(b\) clearly indicate that certain of your third party partners, like and including AppyBuilder, will have access to and will use your customer information on an aggregate and anonymized basis, for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes.
