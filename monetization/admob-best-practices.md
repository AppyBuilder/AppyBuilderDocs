# AdMob Best Practices

## BANNER

---

A banner ad is an advertisement displayed into a web page or app. The advertisement consists of an image \(.jpg, .png, .gif\) or of a multimedia object \(usually created using Flash\). Thus, banner ads can be static or animated, depending on the technology used to make them.  
The banner must be placed in a specific zone created for it for example on the top or on the bottom where there isn’t an high user activity.  
The app content mustn’t be confused with the ad.

---

**WHERE I CAN PLACE THE BANNER?**

* In a zone where the user activity isn’t high
* Preferably on the bottom or on the top

---

**HOW MANY BANNERS I CAN PLACE?**

* The recommended numbers of banners in a page is &lt;=2

The banners should cover maximum the 20% of the page

---

**WHERE I **_**CAN NOT **_**PLACE THE BANNER?**

* You can’t place the banner on a loading screen \(example: splashscreen\)
* Near to an element that can expand or reduce it size \(example: textbox\)

---

**HOW OFTEN I SHOULD REFRESH THE BANNER? \(LOAD AND SHOW AD\)?**

* Preferably every 1/1:30 min

---

**WHAT I CAN’T DO?**

* Clicks or impressions generated by publishers clicking on their own live ads
* Repeated ad clicks or impressions generated by one or more users
* Publishers encouraging clicks on their ads \(examples may include: any language encouraging users to click on ads; ad implementations that may cause a high volume of accidental clicks; etc.\)
* Automated clicking tools or traffic sources, robots, or other deceptive software

## Interstitial ad

Interstitial ads are full-screen ad formats covering the interface of an app and appearing at natural app transition points like pausing a game. Users have the option to skip the ad if they want. The main difference between a banner ad and an interstitial ad is that interstitial ads cover all the screen, and it makes it catchier and more effective.

##### **IS THE INTERSTITIAL AD THE CORRECT AD FORMAT FOR MY APP?**

Interstitial ads are best suited for apps with linear user experiences. There should be very clear starting and stopping points in an app. If you have an app that may not meet this criteria \(e.g., utility apps like flashlight apps\), consider using another AdMob ad format such as a banner ad.

##### **WHEN I CAN SHOW INTERSTITIAL?**

* You can show interstitial ad at the end of a level or when the user finish an action

**WHEN I **_**CAN NOT **_**SHOW INTERSTITIAL?**

* You can’t show an Interstitial ad while the user is playing or when the user activity is very high

**WHAT I CAN’T DO?**

* Clicks or impressions generated by publishers clicking on their own live ads
* Repeated ad clicks or impressions generated by one or more users
* Publishers encouraging clicks on their ads \(examples may include: any language encouraging users to click on ads; ad implementations that may cause a high volume of accidental clicks; etc.\)
* Automated clicking tools or traffic sources, robots, or other deceptive software

## WHAT IS ECPM?

The acronym eCPM means ‘effective cost per mille’. It is the outcome of a calculation of the ad revenue generated by a banner or campagne, divided by the number of ad impressions of that banner or campaign expressed in units of 1,000. The ‘M’ for mille in the name comes from the Latin meaning 1,000. The formula to calculate eCPM is not all that complicated, once you realize the components that go into the computation.

## WHAT IS THE FLOOR?

Essentially, AdMob eCPM floor is an additional network you can set up in your mediation flow. Define your placement order with eCPM values, and you can give this network an eCPM value representing a floor. AdMob will only serve an ad if it thinks it’s worth at least that eCPM value.
