2. 1. _Click the +/- buttons in the lower left corner above the trashcan._
   2. _Ctrl+Mouse wheel on a mouse._
   3. _Multi-touch trackpad users with Chrome, zooming can also be done with the pinch/expand gesture._
3. _Added the ability to pan the workspace. Panning gestures include:_
4. 1. _Mouse wheel up/down will pan the view vertical._
   2. _Wheels with 2-dimensional scrolling can also pan left/right._
   3. _Multi-touch trackpad users can pan in two dimensions using two-finger scrolling._
5. _Added Reset to center button will set the zoom back to 1:1 and move to the center of the blocks workspace._
6. _Added workspace grid. Right-clicking \(Ctrl+Click on Mac\) on the workspace brings up a context menu with "Enable Workspace Grid" option. This option is a user setting and will persist across workspaces and across App Inventor sessions._
7. _Added workspace snapping. If the grid is enabled, another menu option "Enable Snap to Grid" will be available. Enabling this option will make the top-left corner of blocks snap to the nearest grid point. This option is a user setting and will persist across workspaces and across App Inventor sessions._
